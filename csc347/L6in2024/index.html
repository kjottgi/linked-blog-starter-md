	<h1>Lab: Bandit Wargames</h1>
	<ul>
		<li> Go to <a href=https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/>Bandit War Games</a> <b> and read what's there.</b></li>
		<li> As you complete a level, record your progress in myAccomplishments.txt.<br>
			For each level, record the code (see below), if you managed to get the password(s) with a single command, optionally you can choose to record that command (might be helpful: see caveat below)
			and the passwords you find (or at the final level you reach, report
			why you got stuck; "getting 100% is enough and I have other courses too" is a sufficient reason to stop). Note: it is required to include the passwords AND the command(s)/steps.
<xmp>
Code: 0 = didn't do it
Code: 1 = followed a solution
Code: 2 = followed and understood a solution
Code: 3 = solved it myself
</xmp>
		</li>
		<li>Submit myAccomplishments.txt to MarkUs before the deadline.</li>
		<li>Your submission is (mostly) on the honour system. <b>Be honest</b>.</li>
		<li>If you make it to at least Level 10 (with code 1, 2, or 3) you'll get 50%.</li>
		<li>If you make it to at least Level 14 to 15 (with code 1, 2, or 3) you'll get 75%.</li>
		<li>If you make it to at least level 20 you'll get full marks for the lab (with code 1,2,3).</li>
		<li>If you make it to at least level 25 you'll get 125% (only with code 2 or 3). </li>
		<li>If you make it to at least level 30 you'll get 140% (only with code 2 or 3). </li>
		<li>If you make it to at least level 33, you'll get 200% (only with code 2 or 3).</li>
		<br>

			You are expected to work on level 0 to level 14 on your own (plus Google). <br>
			Feel free to discuss/ask questions on piazza for anything level 15 and up (I made two sample posts for level 14 to level 15 and level 15 to level 16, just use those as a template)
			 and help each other get 150%. Essentially it's ok to help each other get to <code> code 2</code> for level 15 and onwards.<br>Remember: zipped files get zeros! (anything that's not plain text gets a zero)<br><br>

			<b> Caveat: For this lab, I may randomly select approximately 10 people and individually interview you on how you reached certain levels.
				In the interview you will be exptected to explain several levels' solutions, how you found the solutions, etc. (
				if you did the work and/or understand the solution, that means you learned something and you'll be fine, so don't worry about it, take notes on how you solved things).</b>
